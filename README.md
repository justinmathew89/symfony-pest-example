# PEST Example in symfony
This is an experimental repo to test the pest testing framework in SYmfony

### Setup instruction
Run `docker-compose up`
this will run the container and install all the dependencies

### The experiment
This is just a learning experiment to try out different test runner.

Since PEST is built on top of PHPUnit, we can see here that both syntax are okay when using PEST as testrunner

This is an advantage since PEST provides additional features and is more readable and doesn't make the existing unit tests redundant
